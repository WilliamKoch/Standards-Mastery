# 1819-NSA-Standards-Mastery

# Description
A python script for tracking student mastery across standards over time. The project reads output files from the Illuminate Ed platform, processes the data using Pandas, and then uploads it into a Google Sheet for sharing and further manipulation

# Installation
Requires Python 3.x
Please maintain directory structure.
The one difficulty in setting this project up is the necessity for a Google API projects code. Please see here: https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential?_ga=2.42509664.432673574.1612969246-751917437.1612969246
Then download the JSON of the credentials to the same directory as the masteryTrack_v11.ipynb file.
